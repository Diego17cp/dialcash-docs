After considerable planning, testing, and adjustments, **Dialcash v1.0.0** marks the first stable release of the application.

This version doesn't aim to compete with giant financial apps or fill itself with complex graphs.  
Its goal is much simpler (and honest): **allow you to record and understand your money without depending on the cloud or creating accounts**.

---

## What is Dialcash?

Dialcash is an Android application for **local expense and income tracking**.

This means:
- You don't need to create an account
- There are no servers
- No data is sent anywhere
- All information lives on your device

The app is designed for people who want to **control their money without friction**, without distractions, and with complete privacy.

---

## What Dialcash v1.0.0 Includes

This first version focuses on covering the essentials, but doing it well.

### Transaction Recording

You can record:
- Expenses
- Income
- One-time or recurring movements

Each transaction includes:
- Amount
- Associated account
- Type
- Date
- Optional description

The focus is on making recording quick and not burdensome.

---

### Account System

Dialcash works with **multiple accounts**, for example:
- Cash
- Bank account
- Savings
- Credit card

When creating an account, you can define its type and whether it's considered a **main account**.

Main accounts are important because:
- They appear on the main screen
- Their amounts are summed to form the **general budget**

This provides a clear view of actually available money.

---

### Transfers Between Accounts

The app allows **internal transfers** between accounts.

For example:
- Moving money from a bank account to cash
- Transferring balance from savings to daily expenses

These transfers:
- Don't alter the total balance
- Keep the history clear
- Avoid duplicate records

---

### Transaction History

All transactions are stored in a history ordered by:
- Most recent first

Additionally, it includes:
- Filters
- Quick search
- Clear view to review old movements

This makes it easy to find any transaction without wasting time.

---

### Data Backup and Recovery

One of the key points of Dialcash v1 is the **local backup system**.

The app allows:
- Exporting a backup of all data
- Manually choosing the destination folder
- Restoring information when necessary

This is especially important if you:
- Change phones
- Reinstall the app
- Need to start from scratch

---

### Complete Account Deletion

Dialcash includes an option to **delete the account and reset the app**.

This action:
- Deletes all local data
- Leaves the application as if freshly installed

That's why it's recommended to **create a backup first**, since without it, data cannot be recovered.

---

## Why Start This Way

Dialcash v1.0.0 doesn't try to do everything.

There are no:
- Advanced graphics
- Cloud synchronization
- Artificial intelligence
- Complex automations

And it's intentional.

The priority is:
- Stability
- Simplicity
- Complete user control over their data

---

## What's Next

This first version establishes the project's foundation.

From here, the focus will be on:
- Improving user experience
- Polishing existing flows
- Adding features only if they truly provide value

Dialcash grows step by step, without losing its core idea:
**your money, your data, your control**.
