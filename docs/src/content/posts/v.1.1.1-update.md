# 🚀 Dialcash v1.1.1

This release marks a major step forward for Dialcash.  
While the core experience remains familiar, the foundations of the app have been significantly strengthened to support faster iteration, better UX, and upcoming features.

---

## ✨ Added
- New chartsscreen for your transactions for better **reading and monthly visualization**
- Initial **content integration foundation**, enabling the app to consume external, structured content (blog / tips) via lightweight JSON feeds.
- Internal groundwork for **in-app update checks**, preparing the app to notify users about new versions automatically.

---

## 🎨 Improved
- UI and UX refinements across multiple screens for better visual consistency and clarity.
- Improved visual identity through more consistent gradients and color usage across transaction types.
- Better overall navigation flow and interaction feedback.

---

## 🧠 Under the Hood
- Architectural changes focused on **scalability and future extensibility**, not just short-term features.
- The app is now prepared to support:
  - In-app content feeds
  - Automatic update notifications
  - Network caching and version checks
  - Easier testing and debugging
---

## ⚠️ Important Notice
This will be the **last version installed from this source**.

Starting with future releases:
- New updates will be **announced directly inside the app**
- Users will be notified automatically when a new version is available

No more manual checks — Dialcash will take care of it.
