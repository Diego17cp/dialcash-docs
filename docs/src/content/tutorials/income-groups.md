## What is an Income Group?

An **income group** is a special income source that you want to track separately from your general budget.

It's not a category or an expense.
It's a way to tell Dialcash:

> "This money came from here, and I want to know how much is left after spending."

Common examples:
- Monthly salary
- Bonus payment
- Freelance project payment
- Gift money
- Tax refund

## Why Use Income Groups?

Income groups help you answer important questions:
- "How much of my bonus is left?"
- "Did I already spend all the freelance payment?"
- "Where did that specific income go?"

Without income groups, all money blends together in your budget.
With them, you get **focused tracking** on specific income sources.

## Creating an Income Group

To create an income group, you must first **record an income transaction**.

### Step 1: Record the Income
1. Go to **New Transaction**
2. Select **Income**
3. Enter the amount received
4. Choose the account
5. Add a description (optional)
6. Save the transaction

### Step 2: Create the Income Group
1. Navigate to **Income Groups** section
2. Tap **Create New Income Group**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "January Salary", "Client XYZ Payment")
4. Select or enter the amount
5. Save the income group

That income:
- Adds to your general budget (if it's in a main account)
- Becomes available as a trackable income group

## Associating Expenses with Income Groups

When you make a purchase, you can link it to an income group.

### How to Link an Expense
1. Go to **New Transaction**
2. Select **Expense**
3. Enter the amount
4. Choose the account
5. In the **Income Group** option, select an existing group
6. Save the expense

This tells Dialcash that this expense came from that specific income source.

## Tracking Remaining Balance

Each income group shows:
- **Initial amount**: The original income received
- **Remaining balance**: Money still available from that source
- **Spent amount**: Total expenses linked to this income

This allows you to quickly see:
- "How much of this money do I still have?"
- "Have I already spent this entire income?"

No manual calculations needed.

---

## Relationship with General Budget

It's important to understand:

- Income groups **don't replace** your budget
- The money is still part of your total balance
- Income groups add an **extra layer of tracking**

Think of them as a magnifying glass over a specific income source.

The general budget shows your total available money.
Income groups show how specific money is being used.

---

## When to Use Income Groups

Income groups are ideal when:
- You receive one-time or irregular income
- You want to avoid overspending specific money
- You need to justify how certain funds were used
- You're saving income for a specific purpose
- You want to separate different income streams

If you don't need that level of detail, you can continue using Dialcash normally without income groups.
