## Accessing Account Details

In Dialcash, all your accounts are accessible from the accounts section.

To view an account:
- Tap an account in the accounts list
- A view will open with its information and balance

From this view you can review and manage the account.

---

## Available Information in an Account

When entering an account's details you can see:
- Account name
- Account type
- Current balance

This allows you to understand the role of that account within your budget.

---

## Editing an Account

Editing an account is useful when:
- You want to change the name
- You need to adjust the account type
- You decide to change its main or non-main account status

When editing an account:
- The budget updates if its main account status changes
- Associated transactions remain intact

No information is lost when editing.

---

## Deleting an Account

Deleting an account is recommended when:
- You no longer use it
- It was created by mistake
- You want to simplify your organization

Before deleting an account, keep in mind:
- The account must be empty or without transactions
- The balance adjusts automatically

This prevents inconsistencies in your history.

---

## Edit or Delete?

A simple rule:

- ✏️ Information change → **Edit**
- ❌ Unnecessary account → **Delete**

Both actions are designed to keep your information clean.

---

## Changes Reflected Automatically

Any change to an account:
- Reflects in the budget
- Adjusts corresponding balances
- Changes or removes associated transactions
- Doesn't affect other accounts

Dialcash takes care of the rest.

---

## Best Practices

- Review your accounts periodically
- Delete the ones you don't use
- Keep only the necessary ones

Fewer accounts, more clarity.

---

## Summary

- You can edit or delete accounts at any time
- Changes are safe and controlled
- The budget adjusts according to configuration

Managing your accounts is an essential part of financial control.
