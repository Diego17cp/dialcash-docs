## What is an Account in Dialcash?

An **account** represents a place where you keep or manage your money.
It's not a bank itself, but a way to organize your money within the app.

Examples of accounts:
- Cash
- Bank account
- Digital wallet
- Savings

Each account has its own balance and movements.

---

## When to Create an Account?

Create an account when:
- You manage money in a different place
- You want to separate expenses or goals
- You need more clarity about your money

It's not mandatory to create many accounts.
More accounts ≠ better control.

## How to Create an Account

When creating an account, Dialcash will ask for some basic information:

### 🏷️ Account Name
A clear name to identify it easily.

Examples:
- Cash
- Main bank
- Savings

---

### 🧾 Account Type
The type helps classify the account according to its use.

Some common types:
- Cash
- Bank
- Digital wallet
- Savings

Choosing the right type makes organization and analysis easier.

---

### 💰 Initial Balance
The money the account starts with.
This allows your information to be correct from the beginning.

---

## Important Note About Main Accounts

When creating an account, you can mark it as a **main account**.

A main account:
- Is considered available money
- Adds to the general budget
- Affects the balance shown on the main screen

Common examples:
- Cash → main ✅
- Main bank account → main ✅
- Savings → usually not main ❌

You can change this option later if your situation changes.

---

## After Creating an Account

Once created:
- The account appears in your account list
- Its balance is used in transactions
- It can affect your budget depending on its configuration

There are no permanent or irreversible settings.

---

## Best Practices

- Use clear names
- Mark as main only available money
- Review your accounts from time to time

A good account structure makes everything else work better.

---

## Summary

- Accounts organize your money
- Each account has its own balance
- Main accounts influence the budget

Creating your accounts properly is the first step to clear financial control.
