## What Does "Delete Account" Do?

Deleting your account in Dialcash **completely resets the application**.

This means it deletes:

- All created accounts
- All transactions
- Transfers between accounts
- Complete history
- Internal configuration

Dialcash becomes as if it was just installed.

---

## Important Before Continuing

Dialcash works **100% locally**.

There is no:
- Cloud accounts
- Servers
- Automatic synchronization

If you delete your account **without a backup**, the data is lost permanently.

---

## Recommendation: Create a Backup First

Before deleting your account:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Enter **Data Backup**
3. Accept the confirmation checkboxes
4. Select a secure folder
5. Save the backup file

This file can be used later to restore all your information.

---

## How to Delete Your Account

1. Open **Settings**
2. Enter the **Account** section
3. Select **Delete Account**
4. Read the warning message
5. Confirm the action

Once confirmed:
- The application restarts
- Local data is deleted
- Dialcash starts from scratch

---

## What Happens After

### If You Have a Backup

You can restore your data from:
**Settings → Restore Backup**

Once restored, you can:
- Unlink the file
- Use a new one
- Or delete it if it's no longer needed

---

### If You Don't Have a Backup

The data cannot be recovered.

That's why this option is intended only for:
- Starting from scratch
- Correcting an inconsistent state
- Completely changing how you use the app

---

## When to Use This Option

Use **Delete Account** only if:

- You want to completely restart Dialcash
- You already created a backup
- You know you will lose current data

Without a backup, this action is irreversible.

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Deleting without backing up
Result: permanent data loss.

### ❌ Thinking it's like logging out
This isn't a logout; it's a complete reset.

### ❌ Forgetting where the backup was saved
Result: useless backup.

---

## Best Practices

- Always create a backup before deleting
- Verify the backup file exists
- Save the file in a secure and accessible place
- Only use this option when strictly necessary

Deleting your account is a serious action that requires precaution.

---

## Summary

- Deleting your account resets Dialcash completely
- Without a backup, data is lost forever
- This action is irreversible
- Always create a backup first

Use this option consciously and with preparation.
