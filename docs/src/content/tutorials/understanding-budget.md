## What is the Budget in Dialcash?

The **budget** in Dialcash represents an overview of your available money.
It's not a magic calculation or a prediction: it's the direct result of your accounts and transactions.

If the budget doesn't look correct, the cause is almost always:
- How your accounts are configured
- Or how you recorded your transactions

---

## How Your Budget is Calculated

Dialcash **doesn't sum everything you have**, it only considers certain accounts.

The budget is calculated from:

- The current balance of your **main accounts**
- The expenses and income recorded in them

👉 Accounts that are NOT main accounts **do not affect the general budget**

---

## What are Main Accounts?

A **main account** is an account that represents money available for your day-to-day.

Common examples:
- Cash
- Main bank account
- Digital wallet

When an account is marked as main:
- Its balance is added to the budget
- Its transactions affect the total shown on the main screen

---

## Which Accounts Should NOT be Main?

Not all money should be counted as available.

Examples of accounts that normally should **not** be main:
- Long-term savings
- Reserved funds
- Money set aside for a specific goal

These accounts exist to better organize your money, but not to inflate your daily budget.

---

## How Transactions Affect the Budget

Each transaction recorded in a main account:
- 💸 Expense → reduces the budget
- 💰 Income → increases the budget

If the transaction is recorded in a non-main account:
- The general budget **doesn't change**
- Only that account's balance is updated

This allows you to keep track without mixing objectives.

---

## Transfers Between Accounts and Budget

Moving money between accounts **doesn't create or destroy money**.

When you transfer money:
- One account's balance goes down
- Another's goes up
- The total budget only changes if one of the accounts is main

This is normal and expected.

---

## Common Mistakes When Interpreting the Budget

### ❌ "My budget doesn't match my real money"
Check:
- Which accounts are marked as main
- If you recorded income as expenses (or vice versa)

---

### ❌ "My budget went up for no reason"
Probably:
- You marked an account as main
- Or you recorded an income without noticing

---

### ❌ "My savings appear as available money"
Solution:
- Unmark that account as main

---

## Best Practices for a Reliable Budget

- Use main accounts only for actually available money
- Record income and expenses in the correct account
- Review your budget frequently
- Adjust account settings if your situation changes

A good budget isn't perfect, it's **useful**.

---

## Summary

The budget in Dialcash:
- Depends on your main accounts
- Changes with each relevant transaction
- Reflects your available money, not all your money

Understanding this will allow you to use the app confidently and avoid confusion.
