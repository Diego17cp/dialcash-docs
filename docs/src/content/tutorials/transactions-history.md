## What is Transaction History?

The **transaction history** gathers all the movements you've recorded in Dialcash.
It's the place where you can review what happened with your money, when, and from which account.

Every registered transaction is stored here.

---

## Transaction Order

Transactions are displayed:
- Sorted by **most recent first**
- Showing essential information at a glance

This allows you to quickly see your latest movements without searching too much.

---

## Accessing Details from History

From the history you can:
- Tap any transaction
- View its complete information
- Edit or delete it if necessary

The history isn't just informative, it's also interactive.

---

## Filters to Find Transactions

When you have many movements, filters help you find what you're looking for without wasting time.

You can filter transactions by:
- Type (expense, income, or transfer)
- Account
- Search by description or name
- Date range

This is ideal for:
- Reviewing specific expenses
- Finding a particular payment
- Analyzing a specific period

---

## Practical Use of Filters

Common examples:
- View only expenses from a specific account
- Search for income from a particular month
- Review a specific category

With filters, the history stops being a long list and becomes a useful tool.

---

## History as a Review Tool

Reviewing your history allows you to:
- Detect unnecessary expenses
- See consumption patterns
- Confirm that everything is correct

It's not about judging, but about understanding.

---

## Best Practices

- Review your history frequently
- Use filters instead of searching manually
- Correct errors as soon as you detect them

A well-used history improves your financial control.

---

## Summary

- All your transactions live in the history
- They're sorted by date
- Filters help you find what you need

The history is Dialcash's financial memory.
