## What is a Transfer?

A **transfer** in Dialcash represents the movement of money between two of your own accounts.

It's not an expense or income.
It's simply moving money from one place to another.

Example:
- Moving money from bank to cash
- Transferring from a digital wallet to a savings account

The total amount remains the same.

---

## When to Use a Transfer

Use transfers when:
- You withdraw cash from the bank
- You move money between personal accounts
- You organize your money in different accounts

Don't use transfers for:
- Purchases
- Payments
- Actual income

For those, use regular transactions.

## How to Record a Transfer

When creating a transfer, Dialcash will ask for:

### 🏦 Source Account
The account where the money comes from.

### 🏦 Destination Account
The account that receives the money.

### 💰 Amount
The quantity you want to transfer.

### 📅 Date
By default, the current date, but you can modify it.

### 📝 Description (optional)
Useful for remembering the reason for the transfer.

---

## How a Transfer Affects Your Accounts

When you make a transfer:
- The source account balance decreases
- The destination account balance increases

Both changes happen at the same time.

---

## Do Transfers Affect the Budget?

It depends on the types of accounts involved:

### 🔹 Between Two Main Accounts
The budget **doesn't change**  
(You just moved the money)

---

### 🔹 Between a Main and Non-Main Account
The budget **does change**, because:
- Money enters or leaves the main accounts group

This is normal and expected.

---

### 🔹 Between Two Non-Main Accounts
The budget **doesn't change**

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Recording a Transfer as an Expense
This incorrectly reduces your budget.

### ❌ Recording a Transfer as Income
This inflates your available money.

If this happens, you can edit or delete the transaction without problem.

---

## Best Practices

- Use transfers only to move money between your accounts
- Review which accounts are main accounts
- Use the description for greater clarity

Transferring correctly avoids confusion later.

---

## Summary

- A transfer is neither an expense nor income
- It only moves money between accounts
- The budget only changes depending on the accounts involved

Understanding this keeps your financial control clean and accurate.
