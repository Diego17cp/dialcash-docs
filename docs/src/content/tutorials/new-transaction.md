## What is a Transaction?

In Dialcash, a **transaction** represents any money movement that affects your budget:
whether it's an expense, income, or transfer between accounts.

Recording your transactions properly is the foundation of financial clarity.
Without data, there's no control.

### 💸 Expense

**Common examples:**
- Daily purchases (groceries, gas, meals)

**Impact:** Reduces your account balance and overall budget.

### 💰 Income
Used when money **enters** an account.

**Common examples:**

### 🔄 Transfer
Used when money **moves between** two of your accounts.
