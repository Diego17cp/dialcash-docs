## Accessing Transaction Details

In Dialcash, all your transactions are accessible for review.

You can view transaction details by:
- Tapping a transaction in the **recent movements** list
- Or selecting it from the **complete transaction list**

Tapping on a transaction opens a view with all its information.

---

## Available Information in a Transaction

In the detail view you can see:
- The amount
- The type (expense or income)
- The date
- The associated account
- The description (if one was added)

This view allows you to confirm everything is correct before making changes.

---

## Editing a Transaction

Editing a transaction is useful when:
- You made a mistake in the amount
- You chose the wrong category
- You recorded the transaction in the wrong account
- You need to correct the date

When you edit a transaction:
- The account balance updates automatically
- The budget recalculates if the account is a main account

You don't need to delete and create again; editing is sufficient.

---

## Deleting a Transaction

Deleting a transaction is recommended when:
- The record was a mistake
- You duplicated a movement
- The transaction never actually occurred

When you delete a transaction:
- The account balance adjusts
- The budget reflects the correct state again

Deleting doesn't damage your information; it simply reverses that movement.

---

## Edit or Delete?

A simple rule:

- ✏️ Minor error → **Edit**
- ❌ Incorrect record → **Delete**

Both options are safe and designed to correct human errors.

---

## Changes Reflected in Real Time

Any edit or deletion:
- Reflects immediately in the history
- Updates the account balance
- Adjusts the budget if applicable

There are no extra steps or hidden confirmations.

---

## Best Practices

- Review your transactions frequently
- Correct errors as soon as you detect them
- Don't be afraid to edit or delete

Dialcash is made to adapt to you, not to punish you for making mistakes.

---

## Summary

- You can access the details of any transaction with a tap
- Editing and deleting are safe actions
- The system adjusts automatically

Controlling your money also means being able to correct it.
