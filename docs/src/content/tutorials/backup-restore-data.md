## Why is Data Backup Important?

Dialcash stores all your information **locally on your device**.
This means you have complete control of your data... but also the responsibility.

If you:
- Uninstall the app
- Change phones
- Reset the system
- Or lose the device

👉 **and you didn't make a backup**, you will lose all your information.

That's why backup isn't optional: it's prevention.

---

## What a Backup in Dialcash Includes

A backup saves:
- Accounts
- Transactions
- Categories
- Internal app configuration

Everything necessary to restore your state exactly as it was.

---

## Before Creating a Backup

Before allowing backup creation, Dialcash will ask you to confirm some important conditions.

### ✔️ Mandatory Confirmations

You must accept one or more checkboxes indicating that you understand:
- Backup is your responsibility
- Dialcash doesn't store copies in the cloud
- Without backup, data cannot be recovered

These confirmations exist to prevent accidental errors.

---

## Creating a Backup

When starting the backup:

### 📁 Destination Selection
You can choose **where to save the backup file**, for example:
- Internal storage
- Specific folder
- External memory

It's important to choose a place that's:
- Easy to remember
- Accessible in the future

---

### 💾 Saving the Destination (Important)

Dialcash remembers the selected destination to:
- Facilitate future backups
- Allow faster restorations

Even so, it's always recommended to know **where your backup is saved**.

---

## When to Make a Backup

It's recommended to create a backup:
- Before changing phones
- Before uninstalling the app
- Periodically if you use the app daily

A recent backup prevents headaches later.

---

## Restoring a Backup

Restoration allows you to recover your data from an existing backup.

When restoring:
- Dialcash will load the information from the file
- The app's state will change to that of the backup
- Current data will be replaced

---

## Confirmations Before Restoring

Before completing the restoration, Dialcash will ask you to confirm that:
- You understand current data will be replaced
- The selected file is correct

This prevents accidental restorations.

---

## After a Restoration

Once the data is restored:
- You can continue using the app normally
- The backup is no longer needed for that restoration

👉 It's recommended to **disconnect or unlink that backup** if it has fulfilled its purpose,
to avoid future confusion.

## Common Use Cases

### 🔁 Phone Change
1. Create backup on old phone
2. Copy file to new device
3. Restore from Dialcash

---

### 🧹 App Reinstallation
1. Create backup
2. Uninstall Dialcash
3. Install again
4. Restore data

---

### ⚠️ Prevention
Create periodic backups for security, even if you don't plan to change devices.

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Not backing up before uninstalling
Result: total data loss.

### ❌ Not remembering where the file was saved
Result: useless backup.

### ❌ Restoring the wrong file
Result: outdated information.

---

## Best Practices

- Make backups regularly
- Save the file in a secure place
- Don't depend on a single backup
- Verify the file exists after creating it

A backup that doesn't exist is the same as having no backup.

---

## Summary

- Dialcash stores your data locally
- Backup is your only way to protect it
- Restoring replaces current data
- Making backups is prevention, not exaggeration

Taking care of your data is part of financial control.
